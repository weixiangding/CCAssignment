	 * Since this problem is not a coding problem, I might explain my solution here.
	 * When (n&(n-1)==0), n and n-1 must not share a 1 at any positions. 
	 * It's easy to know if the least significant bit is 1, then all the bits before it should be zero.
	 * Therefore, this function is to check whether n is a power of 2.
	 * A special case is that when n equals 0, the result is still 0.
	 * Therefore, this function is to check whether n is a power of 2 or n is 0.

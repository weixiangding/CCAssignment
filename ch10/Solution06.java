	// Since this question is asked to explain how to sort a 20 GB file, I will type all the answers here.
	/*
	 * You have to divide the 20 GB file into many small parts because it exceeds the maximum memory capacity
	 * of most personal computers. Therefore, we might divide the 20 GB file to 20 subfiles and first sort these
	 * subfiles separately. By using merge sort, we can merge all the results finally and get the 20 GB file sorted.
